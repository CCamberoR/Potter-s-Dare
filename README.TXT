PROJECT TITLE: Potter’s Dare (PD)

PURPOSE OF PROJECT: The objective of the project is the development of a system
that allows doing a simulation based on the fantastic novels “Harry Potter” saga of . 
In the case of the subject, we have used some names of characters, magic wands, potions, etc. 
But we have made our own adaptation and created a fictional context to adapt it to the contents of OOP taught in PD.

VERSION or DATE:03/01/2020

HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: the project consists of simulating a competition of duels
among the houses of the Hogwarts castle (initially Gryffindor, Hufflepuff and Slytherin) 
in which there will be characters that belong to each of them and that will compete in turns
until there is a champion or the simulation reaches a maximum number of turns.

AUTHORS: Carlos Cambero Rojas & Sergio López López

USER INSTRUCTIONS: To run this project you have to create an object of the class Client in the graphical interface
of bluej, the project will run automatically given that the module that starts the game is in the constructor Client.

if the user wants to change the way that the battle proceeds they can enter the initData module of the class Client
and declare characters, wands, potions, etc... in anyway they like but keep in mind that even the smallest of the change
can affect dramatically the result of the battle.
